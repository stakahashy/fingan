The implementation of "modeling financial time-series with generative adversarial networks"
The numpy files in generated_samples folder are the time-series generated by the GAN model.
To train the model, you need the data of the financial time-series. Due to the copyright issue, we can not publish it here.
Please contact takahashi(at)cl.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp for the information.
